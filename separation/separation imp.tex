\begin{section}{Implementation of State Separation}
In this section we demonstrate the feasibility of experimentally testing the results of the paper by
means of a linear optical experiment.  We find the matrix elements of the unitary evolution operator 
described by Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) and use a modified version \cite{Sun} of the Reck-Zeilinger algorithm to deconstruct
this unitary into a sequence of beam splitters of a six-port interferometer.

Using Eq. (2) and (3)
