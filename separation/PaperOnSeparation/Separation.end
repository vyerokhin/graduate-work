\@doendnote{endnote4}{We may choose $\alpha $ (and $\delimiter "426830A \Phi _1|\Phi _2\delimiter "526930B =\phi $) to be real, since only their real parts show up in the unitarity condition, Eq.\protect \nobreakspace  {}(\ref {unit cond}), and the additional condition $$ 0=\protect \sqrt  {p_1p_2}s' \Im \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\alpha +\protect \sqrt  {q_1q_2}\Im \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\phi $$ is satisfied by the choice $ \Im \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\alpha =\Im \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\phi =0$.}
