This is necessarily sub-optimal since we could probabilistically determine whether we received $|\psi _1\delimiter "526930B $ or $|\psi _2\delimiter "526930B $ by applying UD to the refuse states $|\Phi _i\delimiter "526930B $. Sometimes we would be certain of the input state, when we can always prepare $n$ copies of the state, thereby increasing the overall success rate of the cloning strategy. }
\@doendnote{endnote24}{Using the alternative change of variables $u = \protect \sqrt  {q_1 q_2}$ and\protect \nobreakspace  {}$v = (q_1 + q_2)/2$, the unitary constraint, Eq\protect \nobreakspace  {}(\ref {unit cond}), defines a parabola on the $u$-$v$ plane. Likewise, the failure rate, Eq\protect \nobreakspace  {}(\ref {obj fun}), defines an ellipse with center on the $v$ axis whose eccentricity only depends on $\eta _1$ and $\eta _2$. The size of the ellipse and the $v$ coordinate of its center both increase with $Q$. It follows that $Q_{\protect \rm  min}$ emerges when the ellipse is tangent to the parabola. The intersection of these two conics can be written as a quartic equation. }
