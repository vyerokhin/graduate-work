@article{Bagan2012,
abstract = {In this paper we present the solution to the problem of optimally discriminating among quantum states, i.e., identifying the states with maximum probability of success when a certain fixed rate of inconclusive answers is allowed. By varying the inconclusive rate, the scheme optimally interpolates between Unambiguous and Minimum Error discrimination, the two standard approaches to quantum state discrimination. We introduce a very general method that enables us to obtain the solution in a wide range of cases and give a complete characterization of the minimum discrimination error as a function of the rate of inconclusive answers. A critical value of this rate is identified that coincides with the minimum failure probability in the cases where unambiguous discrimination is possible and provides a natural generalization of it when states cannot be unambiguously discriminated. The method is illustrated on two explicit examples: discrimination of two pure states with arbitrary prior probabilities and discrimination of trine states.},

abstract = {Quantum information- the subject- is a new and exciting area of science, which brings together physics, information theory, computer science and mathematics. "Quantum Information"- the book- is based on two successful lecture courses given to advanced undergraduate and beginning postgraduate students in physics. The intention is to introduce readers at this level to the fundamental, but offer rather simple, ideas behind ground-breaking developments including quantum cryptography, teleportation and quantum computing. The text is necessarily rather mathematical in style, but the mathematics nowhere allowed priority over the key physical ideas. My aim throughout was to be as complete and self- contained but to avoid, as far as possible, lengthy and formal mathematical proofs. Each of the eight chapters is followed by about forty exercise problems with which the reader can test their understanding and hone their skills. These will also provide a valuable resource to tutors and lectures.},

abstract = {In quantum information processing and quantum computing protocols the carrier of information is a quantum system and information is encoded in the state of a quantum system. After processing the information it has to be read out what is equivalent to determining the final state of the system. When the possible final states are not orthogonal this is a highly nontrivial task that constitutes the general area of what is known as quantum state discrimination. It consists in finding measurement schemes that, according to some figure of merit, will determine the state of the system. Optimized measurement schemes often lead to generalized measurements (Positive Operator Valued Measures [POVMs]). In this tutorial review we illustrate the power of the POVM concept on examples relevant to applications in quantum cryptography. In order to keep the flow of the presentation we give a brief introduction to the quantum theory of measurements, including generalized measurements (POVMs), in the Appendices.},

abstract = {Abstract We show how to construct devices which implement non-unitary transformations on quantum systems with a certain probability of success. The first transforms two specified non-orthogonal states to orthogonal ones while the second can be used to enhance the entanglement of quantum states. The states themselves are composed of qubits which are realized as photons in the dual-rail representation, and these photons serve as the inputs to a six-port. One of the outputs is measured, and if a null result is obtained, the desired non-unitary transformation has been carried out. The transformation which takes non-orthogonal to orthogonal states is an optical realization of an optimal quantum measurement for distinguishing the two non-orthogonal states.},

@article{Fuchs1996,
abstract = {This document focuses on translating various information-theoretic measures of distinguishability for probability distributions into measures of distin- guishability for quantum states. These measures should have important appli- cations in quantum cryptography and quantum computation theory. The results reported include the following. An exact expression for the quantum fidelity between two mixed states is derived. The optimal measurement that gives rise to it is studied in detail. Several upper and lower bounds on the quantum mutual information are derived via similar techniques and compared to each other. Of note is a simple derivation of the important upper bound first proved by Holevo and an explicit expression for another (tighter) upper bound that appears implicitly in the same derivation. Several upper and lower bounds to the quan- tum Kullback relative information are derived. The measures developed are also applied to ferreting out the extent to which quantum systems must be disturbed by information gathering measurements. This is tackled in two ways. The first is in setting up a general formalism for describing the tradeoff between inference and disturbance. The main point of this is that it gives a way of expressing the problem so that it appears as algebraic as that of the problem of finding quantum distinguishability measures. The second result on this theme is a theorem that prohibits "broadcasting" an unknown (mixed) quantum state. That is to say, there is no way to replicate an unknown quantum state onto two separate quantum systems when each system is considered without regard to the other. This includes the possibility of correlation or quantum entanglement between the systems. This result is a significant extension and generalization of the standard "no-cloning" theorem for pure states.},

Here, John von Neumann, one of the leading mathematicians of the twentieth century, shows that great insights in quantum physics can be obtained by exploring the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. He begins by presenting the theory of Hermitean operators and Hilbert spaces. These provide the framework for transformation theory, which von Neumann regards as the definitive form of quantum mechanics. Using this theory, he attacks with mathematical rigor some of the general problems of quantum theory, such as quantum statistical mechanics as well as measurement processes. Regarded as a tour de force at the time of publication, this book is still indispensable for those interested in the fundamental issues of quantum mechanics.},

It makes no use of the uncertainty principle of other ill-defined notions. The central part of the book is devoted to Bell's theorem and to the Kochen-Specker theorem. It is here that quantum phenomena depart most radically from classical physics. There has recently been considerable progress on these issues, and the latest developments have been included. The final chapters discuss further topics of current research: spacetime symmetries, quantum thermodynamics and information theory, semiclassical methods, irreversibility, quantum chaos, and especially the measuring process. In particular, it is shown how modern techniques allow the extraction of more information from a physical system than traditional measurement methods.

Several researchers, starting with David Deutsch, have developed models for quantum mechanical computers and have investigated their computational properties. This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. We thus give the first examples of quantum cryptanalysis},

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},
