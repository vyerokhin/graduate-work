\begin_layout Subsection*
state discrimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most vital tools of quantum information theory is reading out
 the information.
 It is the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics that one cannot simply
 obtain information encoded in states, the state is not an observable in
 quantum mechanics.
 When a quantum circuit or processor has acted on the input states to perform
 a task, the output needs to be read out.
 Thus after the processing occurs the task is to determine the state of
 the system.
 If the input states are orthogonal the process is trivial.
 Simply setting up detectors along the orthogonal directions and a click
 in those detectors will determine the state of the system.
 On the other hand discriminating among non orthogonal quantum states is
 not trivial.
 Since quantum mechanics does not allow for perfect discrimination of non
 orthogonal states the task becomes that of a measurement optimization problem.
 Not being able to perfectly discriminate quantum states is key to various
 quantum cryptographic schemes and quantum computing.
 The origin of the measurement optimization field dates back to the 70's
 by the works of Helstrom and Holevo.
 They minimized the average error rate of discriminating the input states.
 The field however gained momentum in the 90's as quantum information theory
 become very active primarily due to the factorization work of Peter Schor
 and quantum key distribution protocols such as B92.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various optimum state discrimination measurement strategies have been developed
 with respect to some figure of merit.
 Two of those methods which we focus on are optimum Unambiguous Discrimination
 (UD) and Minimum Error (ME).
 In UD the observer is not allowed to make an error.
 Whenever he is handed a state 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 he cannot conclude that he was given 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{j}\rangle.$
\end_inset

 We will show that this cannot be done with 100% success rate and that the
 observer must allow for inconclusive results and find an optimum measurement
 strategy which minimizes the average rate of inconclusive results.
 In the Minimum Error strategy the observer is not allowed to have inconclusive
 results.
 Thus errors are allowed and the task is to find optimum measurements that
 minimize the average error rate.
 ME and UD seem to be a special case of a more general scheme of optimum
 state discrimination measurement which can be approached by relaxing the
 conditions at either end.
 In the ME scheme the optimal error rate can be further reduced by allowing
 for some rate of inconclusive results.
 Thus the optimal average error rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E},$
\end_inset

 becomes a function of a given rate of allowed inconclusive results 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}(Q)$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, in UD, the optimal rate of the average inconclusive
 outcomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q,$
\end_inset

 may be reduced by allowing for some error rate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}$
\end_inset

.
 The failure rate becomes a function of a given error rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(P_{E}).$
\end_inset

 The full analytical solution to this interpolation scheme with a Fixed
 Rate of Inconclusive Outcome, 
\begin_inset Formula $FRIO,$
\end_inset

 was first developed by Bagan 
\begin_inset Formula $et$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $al$
\end_inset

 [ref here].
 We provide a different approach to the 
\begin_inset Formula $FRIO$
\end_inset

 scheme using Neumark theorem.
 This approach has the advantage that it lends itself into an experimental
 realization which can be carried out using beam splitters and phase shifters.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
the following is directly from the paper
\end_layout

\end_inset

We have also extended this method to a different class of mixed states,
 states whose spectral form is such that the eigenvectors form a Jordan
 basis for the Hilbert space of the problem.
 The UD of such mixed states has been investigated and the optimal solution
 has been obtained in [21, 22].
 Thus, we know both the UD and the ME limit for these states.
 In this paper we will derive the optimal strategy with a Fixed Rate of
 Inconclusive Outcomes (
\begin_inset Formula $FRIO$
\end_inset

) that optimally interpolates between these two known limits.
 In particular, as the main finding of our paper, we will show that the
 optimal distribution of the fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, among the 2-dimensional subspaces spanned by the pair of Jordan basis
 vectors is highly non-trivial and an interesting threshold-like structure
 emerges: As we start increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=0$
\end_inset

 , first only one subspace receives the entire inconclusive rate.
 Then, as we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 further, at a certain threshold a second subspace starts sharing the inconclusi
ve rate.
 If we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 further, at another threshold a third subspace also starts sharing 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 , and so on, until above a last threshold all subspaces share the available
 inconclusive rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Cloning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we mentioned above, one of the reasons we need to develop optimum state
 discrimination measurement schemes is due to the no cloning theorem of
 Wootters, Zurek
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Wootters1982"

\end_inset

 and Dieks[].
 If one could copy non orthogonal quantum states then by making infinitely
 many copies, it would be possible to distinguish the states.
 Cloning machines which optimize some criteria with a limited degree of
 success have been developed.
 Those cloning machines fall under two categories: universal and state dependent.
 Universal cloning machines, which make copies of a completely unknown quantum
 state, were first developed first by Bŭzek and Hillery[].
 This scheme makes approximate copies of an unknown quantum state while
 optimizing the local fidelity, square overlap of the one of the approximate
 clones and the original state it is suppose to clone.
 The other category of cloning machine is state dependent.
 In this scheme the observer has full knowledge of the prepared states but
 does not know which is the state he is given.
 There are two subcategories within this scheme: approximate and exact cloning.
 Approximate state-dependent cloning machines deterministically generate
 approximate clones from a finite set of non-orthogonal quantum states while
 optimizing the local or global fidelity (the average square overlap between
 full set of approximate clones and the states to be cloned).
 Again Hillery and Buzek[] are the pioneers of this subcategory of cloning
 machines.
 In Exact state-dependent cloning machines, the other subcategory of quantum
 cloning machines, the task is to probabilistically make exact copies of
 the incoming non-orthogonal quantum states.
 This comes at the expense of allowing for failure results where the scheme
 fails to produce a copy altogether.
 Duan and Guo[] were first to develop probabilistic exact cloning machines
 for the two state input where the states are prepared with equal a-priori
 probabilities.

\end_layout

\end_inset

We recently extended this method for the more general case where the a-priori
 probabilities of the incoming states are different.
 This extension not only solves the full problem but gives new insight into
 the nature of quantum cloning.
 The symmetry of the equal priors case completely solves the problem and
 no further optimization can be done.
 This symmetry however hides the true nature of the exact cloning machines
 which show up in the asymmetric case.
 This can be shown through the two step process: exact cloning then optimal
 UD.
 First procedure makes exact clones of the incoming two states.
 The exact clones are then sent to an optimal UD machine where the average
 failure rate is minimized.
 To combine the two step process the inconclusive rate from the cloning
 process is added to the inconclusive rate, weighed with the new a-priori
 probabilities, from the optimal UD.
 When the input states are prepared with equal a-priors the total amount
 of the inconclusive rate reaches the IDP limit.
 Hence cloning then performing optimal UD is equivalent to simply performing
 the optimal UD first, then prepare the clones.
 However this is not true for when the a-priors are different.
 After the two step process the total inconclusive rate is higher then the
 IDP limit.
 This suggests that during the cloning process some information is being
 leaked due to the asymmetry of the failure rate operators.
 When performing exact cloning, clones are produced but no measurement has
 been made, hence we do not know which states are being cloned.
 We simply know whether the procedure was successful or it failed.
 When it fails, the states are discarded.
 This is where the information leakage comes in.
 The state which is prepared most often shall have a higher rate of failure.
 This does not happen in the equal priors case because the failure rate
 are symmetric.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theoretically, the problem of Unambiguously discriminating between nonorthogonal
 but linearly independent quantum states has been solved when allowing for
 failure outcomes.
 The idea is to map the incoming nonorthogonal quantum states onto orthogonal
 states which can then be perfectly distinguished.
 This mapping is a non unitary transformation as the inner product is not
 preserved.
 These non unitary transformation can be performed with some probability
 of success by allowing for inconclusive outcomes.
 The task is to find an implementation scheme which minimizes the average
 probability of failure.
 Choosing a physical system to realize quantum information processes, which
 have otherwise been solved theoretically, is central challenge to building
 a quantum computer.
 Some of the systems in use today are: energy levels of ions, the orientation
 of nuclear spin, the presence or absence of a photon in a cavity [enter
 ref] and dual rail representation of a qubit[]

\end_inset

 We will realize the implementation of our works of interpolation and ME
 using the dual rail representation of photons combined with a six-port,
 which is a linear device with three input and three output ports.
 The six-port can be realized with beamsplitters and phase shifters.
 First we will demonstrate the power and simplicity of this system by working
 out the implementation of UD by JA.

 Then from solving the ME and 
\begin_inset Formula $FRIO$
\end_inset

 via Neumark we show how that by choosing the dual rail representation of
 the photon combined with a six-port the implementation followes naturally.

Quantum State Discrimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Unambiguous Discrimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we give a review of the existing schemes of Unambiguous
 Discrimination (UD).
 Particularly that of two pure states as it is directly related with our
 work.
 When performing UD the detectors are not allowed to make an error.
 We first show that it is not possible to succeed at discriminating quantum
 states with 100% success rate.
 Another detector must be added which accounts for inconclusive results.
 The task is to minimize this rate of inconclusive results.

\begin_layout Subsection
Two pure states via POVM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An ensemble of quantum states is prepared with two possible pure states
 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{1}\rangle$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{2}\rangle.$
\end_inset

 Each state is prepared with an a priori probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}+\eta_{2}=1.$
\end_inset

 The observer has full knowledge of the states and their priors.
 The preparer, Alice, picks up a state and hands it over to the observer,
 Bob.
 Bob's task it to determine which state he is given by performing a single
 measurement or a POVM on the individual system he is given.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observer is not allowed to make an error when making a measurement.
 Let us assume Bob can indeed discriminate the given states with 100% success
 rate.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

 be detectors which cover the full Hilbert space spanned by the states

 the detector

Two pure states via Neumark 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theoretically the problem of minimizing the failure rate for two pure states
 has been solved in the above section.
 However to be able to implement those schemes we resort to Neumark's theorem
 which states that any POVM operator can be realized by generalized measurements.
 [fix it ] The system where the incoming states live are embedded in a larger
 Hilbert space called Ancilla.
 Then a Unitary operator entangles the degrees of freedom of the system
 with those of the Ancilla.
 Then projective measurements are performed in this larger system.
 These measurements will also transform the system states in the original
 Hilbert space because of the entanglement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To show the power of Neumark's theorem we will rederive the optimal failure
 rate of two nonorthogonal states.
 The incoming states 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|\psi_{1}\rangle_{s},|\psi_{2}\rangle_{s}\}$
\end_inset

 which live in the state Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are embedded with the ancilla 
\begin_inset Formula $|i\rangle_{a}$
\end_inset

 which live in the ancilla Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $A.$
\end_inset

 Now the system and the ancilla live in the larger Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $H=S\varotimes A.$
\end_inset

 The incoming states in this larger Hilbert space can be written in the
 product form 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|\psi_{1}\rangle_{s}|i\rangle_{a},|\psi_{2}\rangle_{s}|i\rangle_{a}\}.$
\end_inset

 The unitary operator looks to take the two incoming states and make them
 orthogonal.
 When there is a click on the ancilla 
\begin_inset Formula $|1\rangle_{a}$
\end_inset

 the input states have been separated and and output states 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi'_{i}\rangle_{s}$
\end_inset

 are orthogonal and thus fully distinguishable.
 If there is a click along the ancilla 
\begin_inset Formula $|0\rangle_{a}$
\end_inset

 the incoming states have been collapsed into a single state which carries
 no information.
 That is why the choice on the setup of having the failed 
\begin_inset Formula $|\phi\rangle_{s}$
\end_inset

 state be the same, there should be absolutely no information left in the
 failed state, otherwise it is not optimal.

Minimum Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Minimum Error (ME) strategy one is not allowed to abstain from identifyin
g an incoming state.
 Since it was shown that perfect discrimination is not possible then the
 detectors are allowed to err.
 A click in a detector can only identify a state with some probability of
 success and misidentify the state with some probability of error.

Given an ensemble of two mixed states

 prepared with different a priori probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\eta_{1},\eta_{2}\}$

 the task is to minimize the rate for which the detectors misidentify a

 When the detector 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{i}$

 clicks for state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{j}$
\end_inset

 we consider that an error, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}=Tr(\rho_{i}\Pi_{j}).$
\end_inset

 Thus for two states we want to minimize the following expression.

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda=\eta_{2}\rho_{2}-\eta_{1}\rho_{1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To minimize 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{1}$
\end_inset

 should project onto the eigenvectors of the negative eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda,$
\end_inset

 on the other hand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

 should project onto the positive eigenvectors.
 Let us write 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 into its spectral decomposition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda=\eta_{2}\rho_{2}-\eta_{1}\rho_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{d}\lambda_{i}|\lambda_{i}\rangle\langle\lambda_{i}|
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To implement the projection of the POVM operators onto the positive (or
 negative) eigenvectors the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be split into three categories without any loss of generality: negative,
 positive and zero:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_{i} & < & 0\text{ for }1\leq i<i_{o}\nonumber \\
\lambda_{i} & > & 0\text{ for \ensuremath{i_{o}\leq i<d}}\nonumber \\
\lambda_{i} & = & 0\text{ for \ensuremath{d\leq i<d_{s}} }
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then from the spectral decomposition we can rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $(2.2.6)$
\end_inset

 in terms of the optimal POVM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{E}=\eta_{1}+\sum_{i=1}^{i_{o}-1}\lambda_{i}\langle\lambda_{i}|\Pi_{1}|\lambda_{i}\rangle=\eta_{2}-\sum_{i=i_{o}}^{d_{s}}\lambda_{i}\langle\lambda_{i}|\Pi_{2}|\lambda_{i}\rangle
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{i_{o}-1}\lambda_{i}|\lambda_{i}\rangle\langle\lambda_{i}|$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}=\sum_{i=i_{o}}^{d_{s}}\lambda_{i}|\lambda_{i}\rangle\langle\lambda_{i}|.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The POVMs need to satisfy the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq\langle\lambda_{i}|\Pi_{j}|\lambda_{i}\rangle\leq1$
\end_inset

 which comes from the definition of the normalized probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}=Tr(\rho_{i}\Pi_{j}).$
\end_inset

 These POVMs are basically von Neuman projectors onto the corresponding
 eigenvectors.
 If we now replace the detection operators by the optimal detectors the
 minimum error can be expressed just in terms of the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{E} & = & \eta_{1}-\sum_{i=1}^{i_{o}-1}|\lambda_{i}|=\eta_{2}-\sum_{i=1}^{d_{s}}|\lambda_{i}|\nonumber \\
P_{E} & = & \frac{1}{2}[1-\sum_{i=1}^{d_{s}}|\lambda_{i}|]=\frac{1}{2}[1-Tr|\Lambda|]\nonumber \\

The two fundamental state discrimination strategies are the so-called minimum-er
ror (ME) strategy and the unambiguous discrimination (UD) strategy.
 In ME, every time a system is given and a measurement is performed on it
 a conclusion must be drawn about its state.
 Errors are permitted and in the optimal strategy the probability of making
 an error is minimized 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "helstrom"

\end_inset

.
 In UD, no errors are permitted at the expense of allowing an inconclusive
 measurement outcome to occur.
 When it occurs we don't learn anything about the state of the system and
 in the optimal strategy the probability of the inconclusive outcome is
 minimized 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ivanovic,dieks,peres,jaeger"

\end_inset

.
 It has been recognized that states can be discriminated unambiguously only
 if they are linearly independent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chefles1"

\end_inset

.
 Discrimination with maximum confidence (MC) can be applied to states that
 are not necessarily independent and for linearly independent states it
 reduces to unambiguous discrimination 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "croke,herzog1"

\end_inset

, so it can be regarded as a generalized UD strategy.
 In the MC strategy Bayes' rule is used to maximize the chance of the appropriat
e detector clicking for its desired state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that UD (or MC for linearly dependent states) and ME are the
 two extremes of a more general strategy and one can approach this more
 general strategy from either end.
 Starting from UD one can allow a fixed inconclusive rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 to occur that is smaller than the optimal (minimal) inconclusive rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{C}$
\end_inset

 for UD, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq Q\leq Q_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Then one also needs to allow for errors to occur and one can minimize the
 error rate for the fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 This scheme was introduced by Chefles and Barnett 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "chefles2"

\end_inset

 where they immediately provided the optimal solution for two pure states
 with equal prior probabilities, although at the time they did not prove
 full optimality of their solution.
 Later, Fiurášek and Ježek 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fiurasek"

\end_inset

 generalized this result for mixed states.
 Further useful bounds were obtained in Refs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang,eldar"

\end_inset

, using the method of Semidefinite Programming (SDP).
 Alternatively, one can choose a certain fixed rate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}$
\end_inset

 of errors to occur that is smaller than the optimal minimum error rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq P_{e}\leq P_{E}$
\end_inset

.
 Then one needs to allow for inconclusive outcomes to occur and one can
 minimize the inconclusive rate for a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "touzel"

\end_inset

.
 The first approach yields the minimal error rate as a function of the given
 inconclusive rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}(Q)$
\end_inset

, while the second yields the minimum inconclusive rate as a function of
 the given error rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(P_{e})$
\end_inset

.
 Since the two expressions result from optimizations under different conditions,
 it is not immediately obvious that they are, in fact, the same (in the
 sense of being inverses of each other).
 It is relatively straightforward to prove, however, that this must be true
 and the proof is based on showing that the opposite leads to contradiction

\begin_layout Standard
In a recent burst of activity both approaches were solved analytically for
 two pure states and for other, highly symmetric situations.
 Actually, the second approach was solved earlier, first for two pure states
 with equal priors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "hayashi"

\end_inset

 and then for general occurrence probabilities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sugimoto"

\end_inset

 However the connection with the first approach remained unnoticed in these
 two works.
 Quite recently, the first approach has been solved completely by two groups,
 using entirely different methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Namely, Bagan

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 solved the problem introducing a transformation which formally eliminates
 the inconclusive part of the problem and reduces it to a ME problem with
 an extra optimization parameter.
 On the other hand, Herzog employed the SDP approach to obtain the solution
 for two pure states with arbitrary priors and for classes of special mixed
 states

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this paper is to extend the method developed in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 to a class of mixed states whose spectral form is such that the eigenvectors
 form a Jordan basis for the Hilbert space of the problem.
 The UD of such mixed states has been investigated and the optimal solution
 has been obtained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "HB,BFH"

\end_inset

.
 Later this was extended to programmable quantum state discriminators, where
 in a different context the ME of such mixed states has been solved 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BBFHH"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, we know both the UD and the ME limit for these states.
 In this paper we will derive the optimal strategy with a Fixed Rate of
 Inconclusive Outcomes (FRIO) that optimally interpolates between these
 two known limits.
 In particular, as the main finding of our paper, we will show that the
 optimal distribution of the fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, among the 2-dimensional subspaces spanned by the pair of Jordan basis
 vectors is highly non-trivial and an interesting threshold-like structure
 emerges: As we start increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=0$
\end_inset

, first only one subspace receives the entire inconclusive rate.
 Then, as we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 further, at a certain threshold a second subspace starts sharing the inconclusi
ve rate.
 If we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 further, at another threshold a third subspace also starts sharing 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, and so on, until above a last threshold all subspaces share the available
 inconclusive rate.

 we briefly review the FRIO solution for two pure states, viz.
 the transformation solution found in

 on this method.
 In Sec.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 we extend the FRIO problem to 2 subspaces, each two-dimensional.
 Then, in Sec.
 IV we consider a general Jordan Basis case, consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 two-dimensional subspaces, where a Lagrangian optimization to minimize
 the error rate for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 over all subspaces leads to the threshold structure.
 We illustrate the results on the example where the two mixed states to
 be discriminated are each of rank 3 and together they span a 6-dimensional
 Hilbert space.
 Because of the Jordan structure, the Hilbert space consists of three mutually
 orthogonal 2-dimensional Jordan subspaces.
 In Sec.
 V we deal with the projective regimes separately.
 Finally, in Sec.
 VI we conclude with a discussion.

 for the two pure state optimal FRIO problem since the rest of the paper
 relies heavily on this method.
 We derive the maximum probability of success or, equivalently, the minimum
 probability of error in identifying the states, when a certain fixed rate
 of inconclusive outcomes is allowed.
 By varying the inconclusive rate, the scheme optimally interpolates between
 Unambiguous and Minimum Error discrimination (UD and ME), the two standard
 approaches to quantum state discrimination.

In all of these scenarios (UD, ME or FRIO) one is given a system which is

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2}=|\psi_{2}\rangle\langle\psi_{2}|$

 The pure states are prepared with prior probabilities

In the FRIO strategy we want three measurement outcomes, one that we identify
 with the first state, one that we identify with the second state and one
 that we do not identify with a state, corresponding to the inconclusive
 outcome.
 Therefore, we look for the solution as a three-element POVM (Positive Operator
 Valued Measure), 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{1}+\Pi_{2}+\Pi_{0}=I\ ,\label{POVM}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is the identity operator in the Hilbert space of the states.
 We identify a click in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{1}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{2}$
\end_inset

) with the first (second) state, while a click in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{0}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the inconclusive outcome.
 We wish to optimize (maximize) the success rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{s}=\eta_{1}tr[\Pi_{1}\rho_{1}]+\eta_{2}tr[\Pi_{2}\rho_{2}]$
\end_inset

 or, equivalently, minimize the error rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}=\eta_{1}tr[\Pi_{2}\rho_{1}]+\eta_{2}tr[\Pi_{1}\rho_{2}]$
\end_inset

, for a fixed failure rate, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q=tr[\Pi_{0}(\eta_{1}\rho_{1}+\eta_{2}\rho_{2})]\ .\label{Q}

\end_inset

Obviously, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq Q\leq Q_{{\rm c}}$
\end_inset

 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{{\rm c}}$
\end_inset

 the FRIO strategy reduces to UD with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}=0$
\end_inset

 while for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=0$
\end_inset

 the FRIO strategy reduces to ME with the error rate given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 For a given intermediate value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

 the strategy minimizes

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of solution is based on the observation that, for optimal FRIO,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{0}$
\end_inset

 must be a rank one operator.
 Namely, if we assume the opposite, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a rank two operator then it maps the two input states into a pair of
 other two states that can be further discriminated, contradicting that
 the strategy is optimal.
 The starting point is to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{1}+\Pi_{2}=I-\Pi_{0}\equiv\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 Multiplying both sides of this equation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{-1/2}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\Pi}_{1}+\tilde{\Pi}_{2}=I$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\Pi}_{i}=\Omega^{-1/2}\Pi_{i}\,\Omega^{-1/2}\ge0.\label{tildeops}

\end_inset

So 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\tilde{\Pi}_{1},\tilde{\Pi}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

 is a POVM.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{-1/2}$

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we used that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}-\theta_{2}\equiv\theta$
\end_inset

 It follows from
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{1}$

\end_inset

 The minimization over

\end_inset

 simplifies considerably, using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}\,\eta_{2}^{1/2}(\eta_{1}c_{1}^{2}+\eta_{2}c_{2}^{2})^{-1/2}\equiv\sin\varphi$

 mixed states that exhibit a Jordan structure.
 The two states, with their respective 
\emph on
prior
\emph default
 probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}$
\end_inset

, are given in spectral (diagonal) form as, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rho_{1} & = & \sum_{i=1}^{N}r_{i}\vert r_{i}\rangle\langle r_{i}\vert\nonumber \\
\rho_{2} & = & \sum_{i=1}^{N}s_{i}\vert s_{i}\rangle\langle s_{i}\vert\ .\label{rho1and2}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle r_{i}\vert r_{j}\rangle=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle s_{i}\vert s_{j}\rangle=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 Each density matrix has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and together they span a 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 dimensional Hilbert space.
 We assume that the Jordan condition, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle r_{i}\vert s_{j}\rangle=\delta_{ij}\cos\theta_{i}\ ,\label{jordan}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

holds so the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\vert r_{i}\rangle,\vert s_{i}\rangle\vert i=1,\ldots,N\rangle\}$
\end_inset

 forms a Jordan basis for the 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 dimensional Hilbert space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the Jordan structure, instead of one 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

 dimensional problem we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 mutually orthogonal 2-dimensional subspaces.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 subspace is spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert r_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert s_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 with 
\emph on
prior
\emph default
 probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}r_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}s_{i}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The full discrimination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be accomplished by performing the discrimination in each subspace independe
ntly of the others, i.e., by discriminating 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert r_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert s_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 in each subspace which is much simpler than the original problem.
 A physical implementation of this scheme is provided, e.g., by the transmission
 of two input states over several optical fibers.
 Each fiber contains two degrees of freedom, that could be two orthogonal
 polarizations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present section we will focus on the 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 case when we have to deal with two 2-dimensional subspaces only.
 We leave the general case of arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

As discussed above, in this case we are dealing with two orthogonal 2-dimensiona
l subspaces.

 subspace is spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\vert r_{i}\rangle,\vert s_{i}\rangle\}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$

 and our task is to perform the optimal FRIO discrimination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\vert r_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert s_{i}\rangle\}$
\end_inset

 within subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 The prior probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert r_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}r_{i}$
\end_inset

 while the prior probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vert s_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}s_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We define their normalized probabilities as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\eta_{1,i} & \equiv & \frac{\eta_{1}r_{i}}{\eta_{1}r_{i}+\eta_{2}s_{i}},\nonumber \\
\eta_{2,i} & \equiv & \frac{\eta_{2}s_{i}}{\eta_{1}r_{i}+\eta_{2}s_{i}}\ ,\label{etaij}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1,i}+\eta_{2,i}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now introduce a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes for subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $0\leq Q_{i}\leq Q_{c,i}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c,i}$
\end_inset

 is given by Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 with the obvious substitutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}\rightarrow\eta_{1,i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}\rightarrow\eta_{2,i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\theta\rightarrow\cos\theta_{i}=\langle r_{i}\vert s_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

.
 We note that this reduces the problem to the FRIO discrimination of two
 pure states in subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, with prior probabilities given above.
 It follows immediately that the solution is given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 in the POVM regime of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}\leq Q_{c,i},Q_{th,i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 in the projective regime of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{th,i}<Q_{i}\leq Q_{c,i}$
\end_inset

, again with the above substitutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following we will focus mainly on the POVM regime where the solution
 in each subspace is given explicitly by Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{e,i}=\frac{1}{2}(1-Q_{i}-\sqrt{(1-Q_{i})^{2}-(Q_{0,i}-Q_{i})^{2}})\ ,\label{Pei2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0,i}=2\sqrt{\eta_{1,i}\eta_{2,i}}\langle r_{i}|s_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$
\end_inset

).
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}$
\end_inset

 was introduced in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "Qmax"

\end_inset

 for the single subspace (two pure states) case, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0,i}$
\end_inset

 is its generalization for the case of two (or many) subspaces.
 We introduce the weight 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{i}$
\end_inset

 of subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{1}r_{i}+\eta_{2}s_{i}=\omega_{i}\ ,\label{omegai}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, obviously, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}=1\ .\label{weights}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then the total error rate can be written as a weighted sum of the error
 rates of the individual subspaces 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{e}=\omega_{1}P_{e,1}+\omega_{2}P_{e,2}\ .\label{Pe2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the total inconclusive rate is a weighted sum of the inconclusive
 rates of the individual subspaces, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q=\omega_{1}Q_{1}+\omega_{2}Q_{2}\ .\label{Qtot2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We notice now that the total inconclusive rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is fixed, with the fixed value satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq Q\leq Q_{0}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q_{0}\equiv\omega_{1}Q_{0,1}+\omega_{2}Q_{0,2}\ ,\label{Q0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is the maximal inconclusive rate that the two subspaces can accommodate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task is to determine the optimal distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 between the two subspaces, under the constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 each subspace contributes to the total inconclusive rate according to its
 weight.
  This, however, turns out not to be the case and the optimal distribution
 of the the total inconclusive rate between the two subspaces is far from
 being trivial.
 We can find the optimal $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ in the following way.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "Qtot2"

\end_inset

 tells us that only one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

s, say 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

, is an independent variable, since 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}=(Q-\omega_{1}Q_{1})/\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Inserting this into Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "Pe2"

\end_inset

 it becomes a function of the independent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 It can then be optimized with respect to this variable, yielding an optimal
 distribution of the fixed inconclusive outcomes between the two subspaces.
 Without loss of generality in what follows we assume the hierarchy 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q_{0,1}\geq Q_{0,2}\ .\label{hierarchy2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The optimization corresponds to finding the solution to 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial P_{e}/\partial Q_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 If we introduce the notation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q_{th}^{(1)}=0\ \ \ \ Q_{th}^{(2)}\equiv\frac{\omega_{1}(Q_{0,1}-Q_{0,2})}{1-Q_{0,2}}\ ,\label{Qth12}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

the result of this straightforward optimization can be written as

Clearly, Eq.

\end_inset

 is satisfied by these solutions but there is no range where the naive expectati
on, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}=Q_{2}=Q$
\end_inset

, would hold.
 The subspace with the larger 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0,i}$
\end_inset

 which is the first subspace in our specific case, always accommodates a
 higher rate of inconclusive outcomes than the subspace with the lower 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0,i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most interesting aspect of the optimal solution is that a threshold
 structure emerges.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $Q<Q_{th}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

 the second subspace does not accommodate any inconclusive outcome at all
 and it operates at the Minimum Error level.
 In this region of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 all the inconclusive outcome is accommodated by the first subspace only.
 Above this threshold the two subspaces share the available inconclusive
 rate.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}Q_{0,1}>\omega_{2}Q_{0,2}$
\end_inset

, the first subspace always accommodates more inconclusive rate than the
 second, otherwise above some value of the total 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 the second subspace will accommodate more inconclusive rate than the first.

The remaining task is to determine the optimal distribution of

 subspaces, under the constraint of Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to perform the optimization we employ the Lagrange multiplier method
 because it leads to more symmetric and easily tractable equations.
 To minimize the overall error rate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}=\sum_{Pi=1}^{N}\frac{\omega_{i}}{2}(1-Q_{i}-\sqrt{(1-Q_{i})^{2}-(Q_{0,i}-Q_{i})^{2}})$
\end_inset

 subject to the constraint in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Qtot2"

\end_inset

 we form the function with one constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda.$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\omega_{i}}{2}(1-Q_{i}-\sqrt{(1-Q_{i})^{2}-(Q_{0,i}-Q_{i})^{2}})+\lambda(Q-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_{i}Q_{i})\ ,
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We vary the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 treating 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

 as the independent variables.
 Solving the resulting equations together with the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_{i}Q_{i}$
\end_inset

 determines the value of the Lagrange multiplier which minimizes the error
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_{i}P_{e,i}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we present the results it will prove useful to introduce a hierarchy
 of the subspaces.
 So, in what follows we will assume 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Q_{0,1}\geq Q_{0,2}\geq\ldots\geq Q_{0,N}\ ,\label{hierarchy}

\begin_inset Formula $N-k$
\end_inset

 subspaces remain at the minimum error level.
 Finally, in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{th}^{(N)}\leq Q\leq Q_{0}=Q_{max}$
\end_inset

 all 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 subspaces participate in sharing the available inconclusive rate.

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to show that the expressions are continuous at the threshold,
 i.e.
 the expressions valid below the threshold and the ones valid above the
 threshold tend to the same values at the threshold, although their slopes
 are, in general, different below and above the threshold.
 Furthermore, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{i}Q_{0,i}>\omega_{i+1}Q_{0,i+1}$
\end_inset

, the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 subspace always accommodates more inconclusive rate than the 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1^{st}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,\ldots,N$
\end_inset

, otherwise above some value of the total 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $i+1^{st}$
\end_inset

 subspace will accommodate more inconclusive rate than the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 subspace, the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}^{opt}(Q)$
\end_inset

 curves will intersect.

The results presented so far, in Sections III and IV, are valid if the parameter
s are such that in all subspaces we are in the POVM regime, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is in the unshaded region (region II) of Fig.
 1 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 When the parameters are such that in some subspaces we are in the projective

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{i}$
\end_inset

 falls in the shaded regions of Fig.
 1 (regions I and III) for some 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 we have to modify the treatment to account for the fact that the error
 expression for the corresponding subspace, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{e,i}$
\end_inset

, is no longer given by Eq.

 With an obvious generalization, the POVM solution holds in subspace

 holds where the subspace boundary value is given by

Subspace 1 has its maximum failure rate as

 For subspace 2, the maximum failure rate isn't 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0,2}=\sqrt{6}/16\approx.15$
\end_inset

 because it fails one of the SSD conditions and instead 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}^{<}=7/32\approx.21$

\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0,3}=3\sqrt{5}/16\approx.42$

 The failure rate maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{MAX}=Q_{0,1}+Q_{2}^{<}+Q_{3}^{>}\approx.87$

To find which subspace to discard first we find the critical Q's:

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c}^{2}\approx.35$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c}^{3}<0$
\end_inset

, so subspace 2 is discarded first when 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\approx.35$
\end_inset

.
 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{c}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and we do not allow the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 to vary afterward.
 At 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c}^{2}$
\end_inset

 we find the values of the other failure rates to be 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}\approx.06$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{3}\approx.29$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection
Second elimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

 will reach 0 first and indeed this is so.
 Before we find the second set of critical values we find our new constants
 as: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{2}=\sum^{1,3}\omega_{i}=3/4$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}=\sum^{1,3}Q_{0,i}\approx.6$
\end_inset

 Now the critical values read 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c}^{(1)1}\approx.22$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c}^{(1)3}<0$
\end_inset

 so when 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=Q_{c}^{(1)1}$
\end_inset

 we discard subspace 1 and reduce the optimization problem to the single
 subspace case, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{(2)3}=Q$

\begin_layout Section
summary and conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found analytic solutions for the optimal measurements for a fixed
 failure rate for a class of mixed states that can be expressed using a
 Jordan Basis structure.
 This solution interpolates between the minimum error and unambiguous discrimina
tion bounds.
 We found several surprising and unexpected conclusions.
 The first is that the form of the error rate remains the same over all
 subspaces.
 This implies a deep relationship between the measurement strategies of
 pure and mixed states.
 The second is the threshold behavior in the optimization that shuts off
 successive subspaces as the total failure rate decreases.
 This is a new behavior and allows for interesting experimental opportunities.
 The most straightforward is an optical experiment where a single photon
 is split between different fiber optic cables and a separate set of measurement
s is performed on each cable.
 Applications could be considered in cryptography where a key is shared
 over different lines to enhance security without sacrificing overall error
 rate.

\begin_layout Chapter
Quantum Cloning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
No-Cloning Theorem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the schemes described above to discriminate quantum states would
 not be necessary if one could make copies of the non-orthogonal quantum
 states as can be done with classical states.
 If this were possible then the receiver, Bob, after receiving the state
 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{1}\rangle$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{2}\rangle$
\end_inset

 from the preparer, Alice, makes 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 number of copies.
 After a large set of copies the states become nearly orthogonal and almost
 fully distinguishable.
 The average inconclusive rate of failing to distinguish the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 copies of 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{1}\rangle$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{2}\rangle$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{o}=2\sqrt{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}s^{n}.$
\end_inset

 For a large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the inconclusive rate is very small and Bob can discriminate nearly all
 incoming states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus while in classical information it is possible to make exact copies
 of information, as this dissertation is printed on this paper, multiple
 times by a printer.
 The no-cloning theorem restricts the receiver for doing the same with quantum
 states.
 More specifically it is non-orthogonal quantum states which cannot be copied,
 as classical states are a special case of quantum states, that of orthogonal
 states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now show a proof by contradiction of why such a quantum cloning machine
 cannot exist.
 Suppose there is such a cloning machines with an input and an output port.
 Inside the machine there are two slots: 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 slot for the system state,
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle,$
\end_inset

 to be copied, and an 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 slot for the ancilla space where the input state is to be copied.
 Let the ancilla space be in some blank space 
\begin_inset Formula $|0\rangle,$
\end_inset

 then the initial state of the copying machine would be: 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle|0\rangle.$
\end_inset

 A unitary operator would copy the state 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle$

Let there be two possible input states to be copied,

 The unitary operator would do the following.

\begin_layout Standard
The inner product of these equations gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\langle\psi_{2}|\psi_{1}\rangle\langle0|0\rangle=|\langle\psi_{2}|\psi_{1}\rangle|^{2}\Rightarrow s=s^{2}.$
\end_inset

 This condition can be satisfied only if 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

, states are orthogonal, or 
\begin_inset Formula $s=1,$
\end_inset

 the two states are the same.
 But we said that the two states are distinct and non-orthogonal.
 Thus one cannot design a unitary device which makes perfect clones of an
 unknown quantum system deterministically.
 Here we only proved that non-orthogonal pure states cannot be copied through
 a unitary process.
 Other proofs exist which show that this holds for mixed states and also
 for other non-unitary processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since such a machine cannot be designed the next logical step is how to
 build a quantum machine which produces clones similar to the input states
 while allowing for some fidelity or inconclusive results.
 We derive some previous results considering such quantum cloning machines
 and also provide new results for optimal exact cloning with some inconclusive
 rate allowed.
 In a follow up paper we interpolate between the deterministic cloning scheme
 and exact cloning by relaxing some of the conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Exact cloning with failure rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we are concerned with making exact copies of the given quantum state.
 It is indeed possible to make exact copies but only probabilistically.
 This is very similar to the Unambiguous Discrimination where one discriminates
 between a given set of non orthogonal quantum states unambiguously while
 allowing for a failure rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We approach probabilistic cloning via the Neumark formulation.
 The system is embedded in a larger Hilbert space where the extra degrees
 of freedom are customarily called the ancilla.
 Then a unitary transformation entangles the system degrees of freedom with
 those of the ancilla.
 The input states 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|\psi_{1}^{M}\rangle_{s},|\psi_{2}^{M}\rangle_{s}\}$
\end_inset

 which live in the state Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are embedded with the ancilla 
\begin_inset Formula $|i\rangle_{a}$
\end_inset

 which live in the Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $A.$
\end_inset

 Now the system and the ancilla live in the larger Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $H=S\varotimes A.$
\end_inset

 The incoming states in this larger Hilbert space can be written in the
 product form 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|\psi_{1}^{N}\rangle_{s}|i\rangle_{a},|\psi_{2}^{N}\rangle_{s}|i\rangle_{a}\}.$
\end_inset

 The unitary should do the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
U|\psi_{1}^{M}\rangle|i\rangle & = & \sqrt{p_{1}}|\psi_{1}^{N}\rangle|\alpha_{1}\rangle+\sqrt{q_{1}}|\Phi_{1}\rangle\ket 0,\label{eq:clone1}\\
U|\psi_{2}^{M}\rangle|i\rangle & = & \sqrt{p_{2}}|\Psi_{2}^{N}\rangle|\alpha_{2}\rangle+\sqrt{q_{2}}|\Phi_{2}\rangle\ket 0,\label{eq:clone2}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the rate of having successfully produced a perfect clone, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the rate of having failed to do so.
 The inner product of each of the above equation with its own transpose
 gives the normalized probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}+q_{i}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

 are the input states we wish to clone and their corresponding ancillas
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $|\alpha_{i}\rangle$
\end_inset

.
 Getting a click in 
\begin_inset Formula $|0\rangle$
\end_inset

 means we have failed to clone and discard the state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the inner product of the transpose of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:clone1"

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 we get the constraint of success and failure rate in terms of the overlap
 of the input states.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s^{M}=\sqrt{p_{1}p_{2}}s^{N}\alpha+\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}}\phi
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\langle\psi_{1}|\psi_{2}\rangle,\quad s'=\langle\Psi_{1}|\Psi_{2}\rangle,\quad\alpha=\langle\alpha_{1}|\alpha_{2}\rangle,\quad\phi=\langle\Phi_{1}|\Phi_{2}\rangle
\]

\end_inset

In the above setup the ancilla corresponding to successfully making a clone
 is distinct.
 The failed states are also distinct.
 That is the most general case.
 In order for the success rates to be optimal we take the ancilla to be
 the same.
 Looking at the constraint we absorb 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, meaning there is more copies which would come at the expense of a lower
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 .
 More explicitly this can be shown for the equal priors case shown below.
 We will now show the the failed states should also be the same.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Phi_{1}\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|\Phi_{2}\rangle$
\end_inset

 are different that means that there is still information left in the failed
 states and we can still perform an Unambiguous State discrimination and
 probabilistically determine whether we received 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{1}\rangle$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{2}\rangle$
\end_inset

 .
 The optimal strategy is one which leaves no information at all in the failed
 states and the overlap 
\family roman

\begin_inset Formula $\langle\Phi_{2}|\Phi_{1}\rangle=1.$
\end_inset

 Any click from the failed state is simply discarded as failure.
 The revised Neumark setup reduces to: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
U|\psi_{1}^{M}\rangle|i\rangle & = & \sqrt{p_{1}}|\psi_{1}^{N}\rangle\ket{\alpha}+\sqrt{q_{1}}|\Phi\rangle\ket 0,\\
U|\psi_{2}^{M}\rangle|i\rangle & = & \sqrt{p_{2}}|\psi_{2}^{N}\rangle|\alpha\rangle+\sqrt{q_{2}}|\Phi\rangle\ket 0,
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraint simplifies into:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s^{M}=\sqrt{p_{1}p_{2}}s^{N}+\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}}.\label{eq:clone overlap}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the input states are prepared with equal a-priori probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}=\eta_{2}=\frac{1}{2},$
\end_inset

 the problem is quite trivial.
 It was first solved by Duan and Guo
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 For equal priors the success and failure rate reduce to: 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=p_{2}=p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}=q_{2}=q$
\end_inset

 The constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 reduces into:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s^{M}=ps^{N}+q,
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
using the unitarity condition 
\begin_inset Formula $p+q=1,$
\end_inset

 the problem can be fully solved:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
s^{M} & = & ps^{N}+(1-p),\nonumber \\
p & = & \frac{1-s^{M}}{1-s^{N}}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and the failure rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $q=1-p=\frac{s^{M}-s^{N}}{1-s^{N}}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the optimization of the probabilistic exact cloning is fully solved
 from the constrained derived from the Neumark setup and no further optimiation
 is needed.
 In the limit of producing infinetily many clones, 
\begin_inset Formula $N\rightarrow inf,$
\end_inset

 the failure rate becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $q=s^{M},$
\end_inset

 which is the IDP limit in unambiguous state discrimination.

using this and the definition of

 which is yet to be determined.
 The derivation starts from the definition at

 Now

 is replaced in the constrained given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and from there the optimal value of

\end_inset

 can be obtained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some prior calculations before replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$

 After some trivial algebra another quadratic equation and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A^{2}-\frac{2s^{2}(\eta_{1}-\eta_{2})}{\eta_{1}s^{4}-\eta_{2}+2\eta_{1}\eta_{2}s/\lambda}A+\frac{\eta_{1}-\eta_{2}s^{4}+2\eta_{1}\eta_{2}s/\lambda}{\eta_{1}s^{4}-\eta_{2}+2\eta_{1}\eta_{2}s/\lambda}=0\label{eq: 2nd quadratic in A}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 should give the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 which in turn gives explicit solution to the minimum individual failure
 rates, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i},$
\end_inset

 and overall optimal failure rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\eta_{1}q_{1}+\eta_{2}q_{2}.$
\end_inset

 Analytically such a solution is hard to achieve as one would have to solve
 a sixth order quadratic equation.
 Simply by plotting the two quadratic equations as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 the solution can be obtained at the intersection of the two graphs.
 There will be multiple intersections, hence multiple values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda.$
\end_inset

 The one which gives the lowest value of the overall failure rate is chosen.

Exact Cloning then Unambiguous Discrimination.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is interesting to see the connection between quantum cloning and state
 discrimination.
 We consider the two step process where we first clone then make a measurement.
 The other way around, state discrimination first then cloning is less interesti
ng because once we have succeed in discriminating a state we can make as
 many copies as we wish by simply preparing them with the knowledge we get
 from the discrimination step.
 On the other hand making a clone then performing state discrimination gives
 some interesting results.
 For the case when the incoming states are prepared with equal priors we
 show that cloning first then performing UD on the cloned states which come
 with some new a priori probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

 reaches the IDP limit.

Deterministic State Dependent Quantum Cloning

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we re-derive the works of Chefles and Barnett in designing
 an approximate quantum cloning machine for two possible input states while
 maximizing the global fidelity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 non orthogonal quantum states with 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 copies each 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle^{\otimes M}=|\psi_{1}\rangle|\psi_{2}\rangle...|\psi_{M}\rangle.$
\end_inset

 The states are unknown and our task is to produce 
\begin_inset Formula $N>M$
\end_inset

 copies, as best as we can.
 Introducing an ancilla state 
\begin_inset Formula $|\chi\rangle$
\end_inset

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $N-M$
\end_inset

 dimensional the goal is to transform the state 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{j}\rangle|\chi\rangle$
\end_inset

 into the state which approximates the N exact copies of the input state
 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{j}^{N}\rangle.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is deterministic cloning, although imperfect, clones are generated
 on demand.
 The authors choose the global fidelity rate to improve the quality of the
 clones so they resemble the given copies as best as possible.
 This measure was introduced by Brub et al [enter citation].
 Thus given a set 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 of non orthogonal states 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle^{\otimes M},$
\end_inset

 we wish to produce a set 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 clones 
\begin_inset Formula $|\phi_{j}\rangle^{\otimes N}$
\end_inset

 while optimizing the global fidelity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F_{MN}=\sum_{j=1}^{K}\eta_{j}|\langle\psi_{j}^{N}|\phi_{j}\rangle|^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other figures of merit can also be used to improve the quality of the clones,
 such as local fidelity.
 The local fidelity is the average fidelity of each of the individual clones
 of each of the N subsystems measured against the input states 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{j}\rangle.$
\end_inset

 The authors choose the global fidelity due to its close connection to state
 discrimination.
 We are also very interested in the connection between cloning and state
 discrimination, particularly in the two step process where clones are first
 produced then they are unambiguously discriminated.
 We discover some very interesting features which are described in another
 section.

\begin_layout Standard
We approach state separation via the Neumark formulation.
 The system is embedded in a larger Hilbert space where the extra degrees
 of freedom are customarily called the ancilla.
 Then a unitary transformation entangles the system degrees of freedom with
 those of the ancilla.
 The input states 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|\psi_{1}\rangle_{s},|\psi_{2}\rangle_{s}\}$
\end_inset

 which live in the state Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are embedded with the ancilla 
\begin_inset Formula $|i\rangle_{a}$
\end_inset

 which live in the Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $A.$
\end_inset

 Now the system and the ancilla live in the larger Hilbert space 
\begin_inset Formula $H=S\varotimes A.$
\end_inset

 The incoming states in this larger Hilbert space can be written in the
 product form 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|\psi_{1}\rangle_{s}|i\rangle_{a},|\psi_{2}\rangle_{s}|i\rangle_{a}\}.$
\end_inset

 The unitary should do the following:

 A projective measurement along the ancilla 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 means that the states have succesfully become more distinguishable with
 a success rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

, otherwise a measurement in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ket f$

, we wish to find out the minimum value of the final overlap 
\begin_inset Formula $s'$
\end_inset

 as a function of the initial overlap 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 The same difficulties encountered in perfect probabilistic cloning show
 up here and we will proceed along the same lines, giving the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $(s,\min s')$
\end_inset

 in parametric form, rather than attempting to give 
\begin_inset Formula $\min s'$
\end_inset

 as a explicit function of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, which would require solving a high degree polynomial equation.
 We choose a change of variables which linearizes the unitarity constrait
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:constraint"

\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{1}p_{1}=t^{2},\quad q_{1}q_{2}=z^{2}.\label{eb cha qs -> z & t}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The condition becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z=s-s't,\qquad0\le t,z\le1,\qquad0\le s'\le s.
\]

\end_inset

It is a straight line in the (first quadrant of the) plane 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 with (negative) slope
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $-s'$
\end_inset

 and crossing the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-axis at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=s$
\end_inset

.
 From the first Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eb cha qs -> z & t"

\end_inset

) we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t^{2}=(1-q_{1})(1-q_{2})=1+z^{2}-q_{1}-q_{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}$
\end_inset

 and substituting back in the second Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eb cha qs -> z & t"

\end_inset

) we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{1}(q_{1}-1+t^{2}-z^{2})+z^{2}=0.
\]

\end_inset

We now solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

 and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{1}=\frac{1+z^{2}-t^{2}\pm\sqrt{(1+z^{2}-t^{2})^{2}-4z^{2}}}{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Similarly, for 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}$
\end_inset

 we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{2}=\frac{1+z^{2}-t^{2}\mp\sqrt{(1+z^{2}-t^{2})^{2}-4z^{2}}}{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\eta_{1}q_{1}+\eta_{2}q_{2}$
\end_inset

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2Q=1+z^{2}-t^{2}\pm(\eta_{1}-\eta_{2})\sqrt{(1+z^{2}-t^{2})^{2}-4z^{2}}.
\]

\end_inset

We now solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 After a bit of algebra we obtain

There is a second point that we need to define.
 We first note that for equal priors the curve is simply the hyperbola 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z^{2}=t^{2}+2Q-1,

which intersects the straight line 
\begin_inset Formula

at the point 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

By trying this solution in 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{2}=\zeta(t^{2})$
\end_inset

 we note that it is actually a general solution for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the straight line 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1-t$
\end_inset

 is tangent to
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $z^{2}=\zeta(t^{2})$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $(Q,1-Q)$
\end_inset

 for any values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $dz/dt=(t/z)(d\zeta/d\tau)$

 Note also that

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Since the interpolation scheme of a general measurement with a Fixed Rate
 of Inconclusive Outcome (FRIO) has been solved by 
\begin_inset Formula $Bagan$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $et$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $al$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bagan2012"

\end_inset

 there has been a quest for a physical realization.
 The authors solved the problem using an operator transformation technique
 that reformulated the intermediate problem into a ME problem with an extra
 optimization parameter.
 Essentially they reduced the problem from a three element POVM to two element
 POVM similar to ME.
 As is the case with POVM solutions, they are not naturally realizable in
 an experimental setting.
 Inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset Formula $Reck$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $et\ al$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Reck1994"

\end_inset

 in which they prove that any finite dimensional unitary operator can be
 constructed in the lab using optical devices.
 We set out to solve the intermediate discrimination problem using the Neumark
 setup.
 This gives us a closed form solution as in 
\begin_inset Formula $Bagan$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $et$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $al.$
\end_inset

 In addition it gives a three dimensional unitary operator.
 Using the 
\begin_inset Formula $Reck$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $at$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $al$
\end_inset

 algorithm we express the unitary in terms of beam splitters with corresponding
 coefficients of transmittance and reflectivity.
 Similarly we give a solution to the Minimum error problem and provide the
 necessary beamsplitters with the corresponding coefficients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Analytical Solution of Interpolation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we solve the intermediate scheme of ME with a Fixed Rate
 of Inconclusive Outcome (FRIO) in two different ways.
 In the first method, through a parametrization, the problem is converted
 into a minimum error whose solution is well known.
 Then there is one last optimization with respect to a 
\begin_inset Formula $FRIO.$
\end_inset

 This method generates the same solution as in 
\begin_inset Formula $Bagan$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $et$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $al$
\end_inset

 in a few lines.
 However to obtain an experimental realization of the interpolation we solve
 it using Neumark's theorem.
 It is a generalized measurement procedure in which the system is embedded
 in a larger Hilbert space with extra degrees of freedom.
 A unitary transformation entangles the system with the extra degree of
 freedom known as ancilla.
 After this interaction has taken place, projective von Neuman measurements
 are carried out on the ancilla.

Our input states are qubits, which can be expressed in general as unit length
 vectors in the two dimensional basis spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $|1\rangle$
\end_inset

 In the output of the transformation, we associate the basis state 
\begin_inset Formula $|1\rangle$

\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{1}\rangle$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $|2\rangle$

 Whenever we get a click in the

Optimal solution with equal prior probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first present the solution where the incoming states are given with
 equal a-priori probabilities, 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}=\eta_{2}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 This implies equal error, success and failure rates: 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}=r_{2}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}=q_{2}$
\end_inset

 Thus the total error and failure rates reduce to: 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}=\eta_{1}r_{1}+\eta_{2}r_{2}=r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\eta_{1}q_{1}+\eta_{2}q_{2}=Q.$

 By varying

 we recover the Helstrom and IDP bounds.
 In the Helstrom bound one is not allowed to have inconclusive results,
 hence setting failure rate to zero,

\begin_layout Subsection
Full Solution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the recent interest in this problem, we feel it is beneficial
 to show two new and different approaches to its solution.
 The first is more conceptual: a renormalization inspired by E.
 Bagan et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bagan2012"

\end_inset

 allows us to rewrite the problem as a ME problem with an implicit dependence
 on the last free parameter, the failure rate of one state with relation
 to the other.
 This greatly simplifies the problem as the solution to the first part is
 well known and the second a straight-forward derivative.
 The second solution is a Lagrange multiplier method that is algebraically
 difficult but useful in its explicit results of individual error rate.
 This in turn is useful in designing an implementation scheme.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transformation of the problem into the Helstrom form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose the following transformation to convert our problem into the well
 known Helstrom form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we define the useful quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv s-\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}}$
\end_inset

 which will serve as normalized overlap: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=\sqrt{p_{1}r_{2}}+\sqrt{p_{2}r_{1}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next we normalize all probabilities in the problem: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
 & \tilde{p}_{i}=\frac{p_{i}}{\alpha_{i}},\nonumber \\
 & \tilde{r_{i}}=\frac{r_{i}}{\alpha_{i}},\nonumber \\
 & \tilde{\omega}=\frac{\omega}{\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}},\\
\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}=1-q_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{r}_{i}+\tilde{p}_{i}=1$
\end_inset

, and we have the overlap in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{r_{i}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{p}_{i}:\tilde{\omega}=\sqrt{\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{r}_{2}}+\sqrt{\tilde{p_{2}}\tilde{r}_{1}}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the above transformation of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 the error rate can be expressed as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_{E}=\tilde{\eta}_{1}\tilde{r}_{1}+\tilde{\eta}_{2}\tilde{r}_{2},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{P}_{E}=\frac{P_{E}}{\eta_{1}\alpha_{1}+\eta_{2}\alpha_{2}}=\frac{P_{E}}{1-Q},\tilde{\eta}_{i}=\frac{\eta_{i}\alpha_{i}}{\eta_{1}\alpha_{1}+\eta_{2}\alpha_{2}}=\frac{\eta_{i}\alpha_{i}}{1-Q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\eta}_{1}+\tilde{\eta}_{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have transformed the problem into a discrimination between two pure states
 with overlap 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\omega}$
\end_inset

 and no explicit failure rate.
 Hence we can simply write down the expression to solution of minimum error
 of two pure states (the Helstrom bound), and then replace the normalized
 quantities with the original expressions: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\tilde{P}_{E} & =\frac{1}{2}[1-\sqrt{1-4\tilde{\eta}_{1}\tilde{\eta}_{2}\tilde{\omega}^{2}}],\nonumber \\
P_{E} & =\frac{1}{2}[(1-Q)-\sqrt{(1-Q)^{2}-4\eta_{1}\eta_{2}(s-\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}})^{2}}].\label{eq:optimize P_e}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have one last optimization.
 Given a fixed rate of the average of inconclusive outcomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q,$
\end_inset

 what are the individual failure rates 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}.$
\end_inset

 To minimize 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:optimize P_e"

\end_inset

 we maximize the square root term 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{(1-Q)^{2}-4\eta_{1}\eta_{2}(s-\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}})^{2}},$
\end_inset

 which in term means to minimize 
\begin_inset Formula $(s-\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}})^{2}=(s^{2}+q_{1}q_{2}-2s\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}}).$
\end_inset

 The overlap term, 
\begin_inset Formula $s,$
\end_inset

 is fixed and we are left with 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}q_{2}-2s\sqrt{q_{1}q_{2}.}$
\end_inset

 Only one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}'s$
\end_inset

 is an independent variable as we fix the overall failure rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\eta_{1}q_{1}+\eta_{2}q_{2}.$

\Theta & = & \frac{\eta_{1}q_{1}Q_{0}-\eta_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}}{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}-2s\sqrt{\frac{\eta_{1}q_{1}Q_{0}-\eta_{1}^{2}q_{1}^{2}}{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}}\\
\Theta & = & \frac{\tilde{q}_{1}Q_{0}-\tilde{q}_{1}^{2}}{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}-2s\sqrt{\frac{\tilde{q}_{1}Q_{0}-\tilde{q}_{1}^{2})}{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}q_{1}=\tilde{q}.$
\end_inset

 Let's optimize with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}_{1}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
0=\frac{\partial\Theta}{\partial\tilde{q}_{1}}=\frac{Q_{0}-2\tilde{q}_{1}}{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}-2s\sqrt{\frac{Q_{0}-2\tilde{q}_{1}}{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
this leads to the optimality condition 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{0}=2\tilde{q}_{1}=2\eta_{1}q_{1}=2\eta_{2}q_{2},$
\end_inset

 giving us the minimal error rate in discriminating two pure states with
 a fixed rate of failure as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{E}=\frac{1}{2}[(1-Q)-\sqrt{(1-Q)^{2}-(Q_{o}-Q)^{2}}].
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{o}=2\sqrt{\eta_{1}\eta_{2}}s$
\end_inset

 is the failure rate in the optimal unambiguous state discrimination, which
 our expression reaches when we set 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}=0$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand when the failure rate is zero we can recover the Helstrom
 bound for two pure states 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{E}=\frac{1}{2}[1-\sqrt{1-4\eta_{1}\eta_{2}s^{2}}].$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection
Lagrange Multipliers Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the above method gives a closed formed solution of the average error

 for state 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{j}\rangle$
\end_inset

 , which are needed for the implementation in calculating the transmittance

 To obtain these expressions we show another solution to the interpolation

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 setting up the function with one Lagrange multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda:$

\begin_layout Standard
Setting the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dF_{(r_{1},r_{2},\lambda)}/dr_{i}$
\end_inset

 to zero then solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}(\lambda)$

, we exploit the symmetry in the resulting equations to solve for the individual
 error rates 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 as a function of the failure rates 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Subsequent substitution into the constraint gives us the optimal value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 Then we can obtain the total minimum error by replacing the expressions
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{e}$
\end_inset

 under the additional constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}q_{1}+\eta_{2}q_{2}=Q$
\end_inset

 This gives us the optimal relationship between failure rates as 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{1}q_{1}=\eta_{2}q_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the total optimal error rate as

\begin_layout Subsection
Choosing the physical implementation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main reason to seek a solution using the Neumark setup is because it
 lends itself into an optical implementation.
 This implementation, as we will see, can be carried out using only linear
 optical elements (beamsplitters and a mirror).
 The possible states are represented by single photons and a photodetector
 will carry out the measurement process at the output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To choose the basis we will start with the two mode vacuum state 
\begin_inset Formula $|00\rangle.$
\end_inset

 The total number of photons in both modes is one.
 This two dimensional Hilbert space where our photons live can be spanned
 by the states 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|10\rangle,|01\rangle\}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $|10\rangle=a_{1}^{\dagger}|00\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $|01\rangle=a_{2}^{\dagger}|00\rangle$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 are different modes of the electromagnetic fields.
 The basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|10\rangle,|01\rangle\}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the basis of qubit in basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}.$
\end_inset

 The most general input state can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle=\alpha_{i}|0\rangle+\beta_{i}|1\rangle=\alpha_{i}|10\rangle+\beta_{i}|01\rangle$
\end_inset

 which can be produced by sending a photon into a beam splitter with some
 transmission and reflection coefficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To represent a qubit in the six-port we need to add another mode, the vacuum
 mode.
 The six-port corresponds to three input and three output ports.
 Our single photon input state can now be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}\rangle_{in}=\sum_{j=1}^{3}c_{j}a_{j}^{\dagger}|000\rangle$
\end_inset

 and the output states 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{i}^{\dagger}\rangle=U|\psi_{i}\rangle_{in}=U\sum_{j=1}^{3}c_{j}a_{j}^{\dagger}U^{\dagger}|000\rangle=\sum_{j=1}^{3}\sum_{k=1}^{3}c_{j}M_{jk}^{\dagger}a_{k}^{\dagger}|000\rangle.$
\end_inset

Solution to the minimum error problem was derived in Chapter II.
 Here we use the explicit solution to error and success rates to construct
 the unitary operator which in turn will be expressed in terms of beamsplitters.
 We start with the Neumark setup where a unitary operator entangles the
 input states with the ancilla.
 Let the input states be 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi_{1}\rangle_{in}=|1\rangle$

summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We derived the optimal rate of error for a fixed failure rate when discriminatin
g between two pure states with fixed a-priori probabilities.
 Along the way we found expressions for the individual error rates.
 Then we created an experimental implementation of this procedure using
 the six-rail representation, and found that three beam-splitters are sufficient
 to perform this experiment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter*
Lagrange Multipliers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our works we have relied quite heavily in the Lagrange multipliers when
 optimizing a function which was under the restriction of a constraint.
 We now show why it works.
 The method can be applied to a function of any number of variable but it
 can be more clearly explained in two variables.
 Suppose that we need to find the stationary points of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are the two variables, subject to the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $g(x,y)=0.$
\end_inset

 If the constraint is simple then we can solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $y,$
\end_inset

 plug it into the function then solve 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial f/\partial y=0.$
\end_inset

 However for slightly more complicated constraint this can easily lead to
 a very high order equation with cannot be solved analytically.
 In the case of exact cloning, doing just so leads to a sixth order equation
 which is of little use.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the stationary points of a function of two variable such as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y),$
\end_inset

 we could just take the total differentia 
\begin_inset Formula $df$
\end_inset

 and set it to zero
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
df=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy=0\label{eq:lagrange 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which leads to two conditions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=0,\ \ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=0\label{eq:lagrange 0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However there is a constraint which means that the differentials 
\begin_inset Formula $dx$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dy$
\end_inset

 are not independent, they are related to the total differential of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dg=\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}dx+\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}dy=0\label{eq:lagrange 2}
\end{equation}

\end_layout

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation can be satisfied by choosing the Lagrange multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 such that the following two conditions are satisfied:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have seen how the Lagrange multipliers method works, we can
 simplify the procedure by optimizing the function following function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(x,y)=f(x,y)+\lambda g(x,y)\label{eq:lagrange full}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The rest of the procedure is the same.
 This is the exact procedure we used for our works, for example in optimizing

 prove that any discrete finite-dimensional unitary operator can be constructed
 using optical devices only.
 Then they provide a general algorithm which decomposes any 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 unitary matrix into a product of two-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $U(2)$
\end_inset

 transformations which can be expressed as beam splitters, phase shifters
 and mirrors.
 This optical multi-port can act upon various fields such as electrons,
 neutrons, atoms, photons etc.
 The authors decide to work with photons purely for convenience and widespread
 availability of high power lasers.
 It is this very proof which allows us to implement our various works in
 state discrimination and cloning.
 In addition the proof has greatly simplified the experimental realizations
 of many quantum computation, quantum information and quantum cryptography
 schemes.
 Besides these very practical applications it has also answered a long standing
 question: Does an experiment measuring the variables corresponding to any
 arbitrary Hermitian operator exists? They show that indeed an experimental
 realization does exist for an arbitrary operator in a finite dimensional
 Hilbert space.

\end_layout

where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{T}=\cos\omega,$

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{R}=\sin\omega.$

 In their Letter Reck,

 considered the use of a Mach-Zehner interferometer to simulate the effect
 of a beam splitter which splits the incoming beam according to the given
 parameters of transmittance and reflectivity.
 For an actual two by two beam splitter the coefficients of transmittance
 and reflectivity should be 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{T}=\sin\omega$

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{R}=\sin\theta.$

\begin_inset Formula $\times$

\end_inset

 unitary matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $U(N),$
\end_inset

 it can be expressed into a succession of two-dimensional matrices which
 correspond to beam splitters and phase shifters.
 Hence the 
\begin_inset Formula $U(N)$
\end_inset

 unitary matrix can be realized in the full 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 dimensional Hilbert space through a succession of two-dimensional 
\begin_inset Formula $U(2)$

 matrices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The order in which the matrices are multiplied correspond to the sequence
 in which the beamsplitters are set up.
 The task of realizing the experimental setup of an arbitrary unitary matrix
 becomes that of factorizing the matrix in terms of two dimensional beam
 splitter matrices with phase shifters which can be realized after the beam
 splitters.

\begin_inset Formula $T_{pq}$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1.$
\end_inset

 In the identity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{pq}$
\end_inset

 the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{pq},\;I_{pp},\;I_{qp},\;I_{qq}$

\begin_inset Formula $(\cos\omega,\sin\omega)$

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
This reduces the dimensionality of 
\begin_inset Formula $U(N)$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $U(N-1).$

 Since the product of matrices represents the order of which the beam splitters
 are set up, then 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:reck-seilinger algorithm"

\end_inset

 is all one needs to implements a finite dimensional unitary matrix.
 Since this algorithm is recursive, it can factorize any finite dimensional
 unitary operator.
 For example a 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 unitary matrix, three beam splitters are needed 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{21},T_{31},T_{32},$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 unitary matrix requires six beamsplitters 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{4,3},T_{4,2},T_{4,1},T_{32},T_{31},T_{21}$
\end_inset

 in reversed order.
 In general the maximum number of beam splitters required for any 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 dimensional unitary operator is 
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{pmatrix}N\\
2
\end{pmatrix}=\frac{N(N-1)}{2}.$
\end_inset

 In practice this method involves a triangular array of beamsplitters, with
 each diagonal row effectively reducing the dimension of the Hilbert space
 by one.

In the dissertation we used various quantum measurements schemes to read
 out information out of a quantum system.
 For a more thorough understanding of quantum theory of measurements we
 go along the lines of the review paper by J.A Bergou

.
 Starting with the standard quantum measurement theory due essentially to
 von Neumann the generalized measurements (Positive Operator Valued Measures,
 POVMs) are introduced as more useful measurements measurement schemes in
 optimization problems.
 Using Neumark's theorem the POVMs can be realized experimentally.
